# HealthHub Presentation: Safety for Every Mind

**(Hook)**
"Emergencies are loud, chaotic, and scary. For a child with **autism**, that sensory overload can be paralyzing, making it impossible to remember what to do. Traditional first-aid training often overlooks this critical need. Today, I present **HealthHub**."

**(The Solution)**
"HealthHub is a **sensory-friendly safety companion** designed specifically for neurodiverse children. We built it to be predictable, structured, and calming—turning complex emergencies into manageable routines."

**(Demo Walkthrough)**
"Let’s see how it empowers our users:"

1.  **Structured Learning (Home Page)**
    "Notice the interface. It's clean and distraction-free. We use a **linear scroll** so the child can focus on one topic at a time, like 'Burns' or 'Bleeding', without being overwhelmed."

2.  **Sensory Regulation (Calm Mode)**
    "Sensory needs change. If the bright interface is too much, a simple tap on the toggle switches the entire app to **'Calm Mode'**. This applies muted, warm-grey tones designed to reduce visual stress and help the user regulate."

3.  **Accessible Instructions (Lesson Page)**
    "Inside a lesson, instructions are broken into bite-sized steps. Ideally suited for different processing styles, we include **Text-to-Speech support** for auditory learners and embedded videos for visual modeling."

**(The "Find Help" Safety Net)**
"In high-stress moments, verbal communication can be difficult. Our 'Find Help' feature uses geolocation to visual display safe zones on a map, giving non-verbal users a way to show others where they need to go."

**(Conclusion)**
"HealthHub isn't just an app; it's an accommodation. It gives autistic kids the tools to be safe, independent, and confident. Thank you."
