# HealthHub Use Cases (Neurodiverse Focus)

1. **Structured Learning**
   The user engages with a simplified, linear interface to learn safety skills. Steps are isolated to prevent cognitive overload, helping the user focus on one instruction at a time.

2. **Sensory Regulation**
   The user switches the app to **"Calm Mode"** (Warm Grey Theme) using the toggle button. This reduces visual noise and glare, making the app usable during moments of high sensory sensitivity.

3. **Accessible Emergency Help**
   In a stressful situation where verbal communication may fail, the user clicks "Find Help". The app provides a clear visual map of safe locations (hospitals) to show to a guardian or bystander.

4. **Gamified Routine (Quiz)**
   The user practices safety knowledge through a predictable, low-pressure quiz. The consistent feedback loop ("Correct/Incorrect") helps reinforce the routine and build confidence.
